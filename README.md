Hi I'm Andrius. I'm currently on a journey to relearn programming (after neglecting my degree for a couple years ðŸ˜…) and become a fullstack javascript developer.

End goal is the accumulate as much knowledge as possible in as many domains as possible to become the most well rounded developer available ðŸ’ª.

You can reach me on my email off.andrius@gmail.com
